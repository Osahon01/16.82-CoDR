# Aircraft Design & Mass Closure Optimization

Aircraft sizing and optimization framework for a preliminary hybrid-electric aircraft design. The repository combines physics-based subsystem models coupling aerodynamic, structural, propulsion, and mission models to enforce mass closure and evaluate design feasibility across a constrained design space. A high-performance C++ optimization backend is used for large design sweeps.
